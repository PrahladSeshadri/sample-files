    <p>The main entrance of IIT Madras is on Sardar Patel Road, flanked by the residential districts of Adyar and Velachery. The campus is close to the Raj Bhavan, the official seat of the Governor of Tamil Nadu. Other entrances are located in Velachery (near Anna Garden MTC bus stop, Velachery Main Road), Gandhi Road and Taramani gate (close to Ascendas Tech Park).
         The campus is located 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Chennai Airport, 12 km (7.5 mi) from the Chennai Central Railway station, and is connected by city buses. Kasturba Nagar is the nearest station on the Chennai MRTS line.
         Two parallel roads, Bonn Avenue and Delhi Avenue, cut through the faculty residential area before they meet at the Gajendra Circle, near the Administrative Block. Buses regularly ply between the Main Gate, Gajendra Circle, the Academic Zone, and the Hostel Zone.
         IIT Madras is the first IIT in India to set up an offshore campus in Tanzania in Africa as part 
         of the Central government's IIT expansion plans abroad.[19][20] In July 2023, education officials
         of India and Tanzania said that an IIT Madras satellite campus in the Tanzanian autonomous territory of Zanzibar would begin offering classes in October 2023 and this has started functioning as announced.[21] IITM - Zanzibar is also the first IIT to have a Woman Director - the Director of the Tanzania Campus is Prof. Preeti Aghalayam.[22] This progressive IIT is now, all set to establish its second international campus in Sri Lanka.</p>
