    <p>In 1956, the West German Government rendered technical assistance to establish a state of the art
       engineering institute in India. Soon, the first Indo-German agreement was signed in Bonn, West 
       Germany in 1959 for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras (now Chennai)
       . IIT Madras was started with technical, academic and financial assistance from the Government of 
       West Germany and was at the time the largest international educational project sponsored by the 
       West German government. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to provide 
       the following assistance in the establishment of a higher technological institute at Madras:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A workshop, laboratory equipment, and a library whose total value does not exceed ₹1.8 crore (equivalent to ₹166 crores or $20 million in 2024) </li>
        <li>Twenty German professors to serve at the institute for a period of four to five years</li>
        <li>Four German foremen for the workshops of the institute for two years</li>
    </ol>
